        "title": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra could be even more powerful than the iPhone 16 Pro Max",
        "body": "The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra playing Call of Duty Mobile (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)\n\nApple's iPhone chipsets are almost always the most powerful smartphone chipsets available, scoring significantly higher than Android rivals in benchmarks. However, things could be different this year - or at least early next year, as that's when we're expecting the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra to launch - with a new benchmark leak suggesting it could have Apple beat.\n\nA Geekbench result for the phone was shared by leaker @UniverseIce on X, and it achieved a single-core score of 3,011 and a multi-core result of 9,706. To put that in perspective, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra has an average single-core score of 2,142 and an average multi-core score of 6,693. So this would make for a huge upgrade on the current model.\n\nNot only that, it would also likely outperform the A18 Pro chipset in the iPhone 16 Pro Max, at least for multi-core results.\n\nThere haven't been enough tests of the A18 Pro yet for Geekbench to display its average scores, but in our own tests we found the iPhone 16 Pro Max had a single-core result of 3,386 and a multi-core result of 8,306 - that's still better than Samsung in single-core tests, but way behind the Galaxy S25 Ultra for multi-core.\n\nNow, there are a few things to bear in mind here. First of all, this is just one benchmark, and an early one at that, so it's very possible that it won't end up being representative of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's actual performance.\n\nPlus, this is a model of the phone with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset, and it's possible that in some regions it will get an Exynos chipset instead. That's quite likely for some models in the Samsung Galaxy S25 line anyway, based on past form.\n\nOn the other hand, many other Android phones will probably also have a Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset, so it could be that quite a few upcoming Android phones can rival or beat the iPhone 16 Pro Max's performance.\n\nWe should have a clearer idea soon, as the likes of the OnePlus 13 and Xiaomi 15 will probably be equipped with this chipset, and are likely to land before the end of the year.",

        "title": "iPhone 16 sales fall short, LGD faces challenges",
        "body": "Apple's iPhone 16 has seen lower-than-expected initial sales, deepening concerns for South Korean display manufacturers. According to recent reports from South Korean media, LG Display (LGD) is facing particularly severe challenges.\n\nCiting industry sources, South Korean media DealSite reported that the iPhone 16 series' initial sales performance has fallen short of expectations, which is expected to impact South Korean OLED panel suppliers' performance in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe iPhone 16 debuted on September 20, in key markets such as South Korea, the US, and China. Although South Korea's three major telecom providers saw their pre-order stock sell out, a closer look revealed that demand for the iPhone 16 differs significantly from the iPhone 15.\n\nSouth Korean media analysis suggests that while the initial supply of iPhone 16 sold out in South Korea, this was due to a lower supply in 2024 compared to 2023, leading to inventory shortages. This is seen as a temporary phenomenon, with similar situations reported in the US and China. Industry sources indicate that global pre-orders for the iPhone 16 have dropped by approximately 13% compared to the iPhone 15.\n\nAn analyst from SK Securities noted that IT demand was initially expected to rebound in the second half of 2024. However, this rebound might not occur until 2025, with sluggish demand in the US and China being the primary factors. The demand for iPhones appears to be affected by weaker consumer demand.\n\nThe iPhone 16 series includes the base model, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and the flagship iPhone 16 Pro Max. Samsung Display (SDC) supplies OLED panels for the entire iPhone 16 series, while LGD provides OLED panels for the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max feature 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch screens. Panel prices for the two aforementioned models are higher than the base model's 6.1-inch display.\n\nOn the surface, SDC seems more vulnerable to iPhone sales performance due to supplying panels for the entire series, approximately twice the supply volume of LGD. However, SDC is less affected since it supplies OLED panels to Samsung Electronics and several Chinese smartphone manufacturers. In contrast, LGD's reliance on Apple as a core client makes the company significantly more vulnerable.\n\nLGD had high hopes for the iPhone 16 in 2024. In 2023, LGD faced delays in supplying panels for iPhones. However, LGD managed to resolve these supply issues in 2024.\n\nSuccessful iPhone 16 sales were expected to boost LGD's performance. However, the much-anticipated \"Apple Intelligence\" on the iPhone 16 isn't fully baked and there is little hardware difference compared to the iPhone 15 series. This is disappointing news for LGD, which hoped to benefit from Apple's orders.\n\nInitially, the South Korean securities industry and market predicted that LGD would return to profitability in the second half of 2024 with the launch of the iPhone 16. However, some are concerned that LGD's recovery might slow due to the underwhelming initial sales of the iPhone 16.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, SDC reported a revenue of KRW7.65 trillion (approx. US$5.734 billion) and an operating profit of KRW1 trillion. In contrast, LGD posted revenue of KRW6.7 trillion in the same period but suffered an operating loss of KRW93.7 billion, making LGD's return to profitability critical.",

        "title": "Why Does My iPhone Keep Asking Me to Check In With My Ex?",
        "body": "Simon was waiting for a ride home one evening when he received a strange notification on his iPhone. It appeared with the iMessage logo, almost like a text message, but it was a suggestion from Siri, Apple's virtual assistant. \"Start a Check In with Daniel,\" the phone prompted him. \"Let them know when you arrive at your destination.\"\n\nSimon, who works in artificial intelligence at a company in British Columbia and asked to be identified only by his first name because he was commenting on the work of another tech company, was amused by the notification and took a screenshot. Daniel was his old roommate who lived nearly 5,000 miles away, on a completely different continent: Why on earth would his phone think he'd want to check in with him?\n\n\"I found it funny,\" Simon said in a phone interview. \"He is in my Favorites on my phone, so I'm guessing that's how Apple does these recommendations. But it still just doesn't make any sense, because I also have his address saved in my contacts, so my phone should know that we live on different continents.\"\n\nOther iPhone users have not been so amused by the Siri feature, which was released with iOS 17 last year. Since then, the internet has been inundated with posts from users wondering why their phones want them to check in with seemingly random contacts.\n\nMany have taken to Reddit, describing the prompts as distressing or surprising, with some saying the messages had caused tension in their relationships over what felt like an attempt to control their movements. One user was asked to Check In with an ex they were no longer in touch with and others were asked to send them to managers, casual acquaintances, old enemies and, on at least one occasion, a deceased mother.\n\nLeo Margul, a 37-year-old writer living in Los Angeles, said that on two occasions he was leaving concerts when Siri prompted him to start a Check In with his mother, who lives across the country in Boston. When he posted the screenshot to Reddit, other users chimed in to say that they had received similar notifications, but that their parents had passed away.\n\n\"Many of the top comments were from folks expressing a deep regret that they didn't speak to their now deceased mother, or parent, when they were still alive,\" Mr. Margul said in an interview. \"Others talked about how they still check in with their mom or parents regardless of their age or sometimes their circumstances.\"\n\nHow exactly the Check In feature works is a secret Apple guards very closely. According to a company news release from June 2023, Check In was designed as a feature \"for when a user wants to notify a family member or friend that they have made it to their destination safely.\"\n\n\"After a user initiates a Check In, their friend or family member will automatically be notified as soon as the user arrives,\" the release said. \"If they are not making progress toward their destination, useful information will be temporarily shared with the selected contact, such as the device's location, battery level and cell service status. Any information shared is end-to-end encrypted.\"\n\nBut how exactly does your phone decide when the time is right to start a Check In? The feature hinges on Siri Suggestions, a function that, according to Apple, is based on a variety of factors, including what information is stored on your device and how you use your phone. Whether or not you actually start the Check In is up to you. Users can also turn off Siri Suggestions entirely, which will stop the notifications.\n\nStill, some iPhone users are skeptical about using Check In without knowing exactly how it works.\n\n\"There's something creepy about the fact that it isn't readily explained how this feature works and how it chooses who to suggest,\" Mr. Margul said. \"That said, ultimately it reminded me to check in with people I would like to contact more often, so I appreciate that. It would just be great to know the exact privacy cost of that suggestion.\"",

        "title": "3 Stocks That Turned $1,000 Into $1 Million (or More) | The Motley Fool",
        "body": "Apple, Amazon, and Berkshire Hathaway minted a lot of millionaires.\n\nFor a stock to turn a $1,000 investment into $1 million, it would need to rally 99,900%. The S&P 500 rose 5,240% over the past 50 years -- so it might seem impossible to find that rare growth stock that could deliver big millionaire-making gains.\n\nYet three of the most valuable companies today -- Apple (AAPL -0.44%), Amazon (AMZN -0.74%), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.59%) (BRK.B -0.48%) -- actually generated those jaw-dropping gains over the past few decades. Let's see how they turned their most patient investors into millionaires and if they can keep growing for the foreseeable future.\n\nApple went public at a split-adjusted price of $0.10 per share on Dec. 12, 1980. A $1,000 investment in its initial public offering (IPO) would be worth $2.28 million today. Apple is now the world's most valuable publicly traded company with a market cap of $3.47 trillion.\n\nThe company was once an underdog maker of personal computers in a market dominated by Windows-powered PCs. Its business stagnated in the late 1980s and early 1990s before its co-founder Steve Jobs returned as its CEO in 1997. Under Jobs, Apple reignited its growth by launching the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. It attracted a new generation of consumers with its sleek new devices and premium price tags and locked them into its walled garden of services.\n\nMany investors wondered if Apple could keep growing after Jobs' death in 2011, but his successor Tim Cook maintained the company's momentum by upgrading its core devices, launching new products like the Apple Watch and AirPods, and expanding its services ecosystem. Apple also returned a lot of its cash to its investors through its buybacks and dividends.\n\nFrom fiscal 1997 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), Apple's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17%. Its business is maturing but could keep growing as it rolls out new devices and artificial intelligence (AI) services.\n\nAmazon went public at a split-adjusted price of $0.075 a share on May 15, 1997. A $1,000 investment in its IPO would have grown to $2.55 million. Amazon is now worth $2.01 trillion, making it the fifth most valuable public company in the world.\n\nAmazon initially sold books through its online store but subsequently expanded its marketplace to sell other types of products. It also opened up its marketplace to third-party sellers. In 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which grew into the world's largest cloud infrastructure platform during the following two decades.\n\nMany skeptics thought Amazon's capital-intensive business model was unsustainable, but economies of scale eventually kicked in across its marketplace and diluted its fulfillment expenses. It also subsidized the expansion of its lower-margin retail business with AWS' higher-margin revenue and locked its shoppers into its sticky Prime subscriptions.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2023, Amazon's revenue rose at a stunning CAGR of 37%. Its growth has slowed down over the past decade, but the company remains a balanced way to profit from the secular expansion of the e-commerce and cloud infrastructure markets. The feverish demand for new AI applications should also generate strong tailwinds for AWS over the next few years.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway was founded in 1839, but its modern history begins with Warren Buffett's full takeover of the company in 1965. After 15 years of expanding and restructuring its business, Berkshire Hathaway listed its Class A shares at an IPO price of $290 on March 16, 1980.\n\nA $1,000 investment in those shares would be worth $2.36 million today. Berkshire now has market cap of $980 billion, making it the world's eighth most valuable public company.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway operates two main growth engines. First, it directly owns a long list of insurance, railroad, utility, and consumer staples businesses. These subsidiaries are mostly recession-resistant businesses that generate lots of cash.\n\nSecond, Berkshire pours a lot of that cash into its closely watched investment portfolio, which consists of more than 50 stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Its top holdings -- which were chosen by Buffett himself -- include Apple, American Express, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola.\n\nBerkshire's well-diversified business was built to withstand recessions, and it's consistently outperformed the S&P 500 ever since its IPO. From 1980 to 2023, its operating earnings (which exclude its investment gains and losses) grew at a CAGR of 17%.\n\nSome investors might be wondering if Berkshire can maintain its momentum after Buffett hands the reins over to his successor Greg Abel. I believe its evergreen business can keep beating the market for decades to come.",

        "title": "Associate Professor of Economics Marc Remer on the Biden Antitrust Legacy",
        "body": "This past Sunday, Lina Khan, the Biden-appointed chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), was featured on \"60 Minutes.\" On the show, she discussed her approach to leading the FTC, which enforces antitrust law and consumer protection. Her approach, along with that of Jonathan Kanter, Biden's United States Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division, has made waves to observers of corporate regulation for marking a shift in policy toward stricter enforcement of corporate merger law and consumer protection efforts.\n\nTo explore these changes, The Phoenix spoke with antitrust expert and Associate Professor of Economics Marc Remer.\n\nAside from research on the calls basketball referees make and racial bias in the hiring of NBA head coaches, Remer has spent most of his career studying antitrust economics. After writing his dissertation on the pricing strategies of gas stations and whether they were colluding with each other, Remer took a job with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the division now led by Mr. Kanter) to study the impact of corporate mergers determining which should be blocked because of negative impacts on consumers. After a family relocation, Remer then became associate professor of economics at Swarthmore, where he now teaches microeconomics and antitrust, which he continues to research.\n\nKhan and Kanter have overseen and directed a much stronger level of federal government regulation of corporate mergers and potentially anti-competitive practices. At the FTC, Khan has brought forward and led high-profile legal battles against major big tech companies, including Amazon, Facebook (Meta), Nvidia, and others, in addition to taking on mergers of grocery store companies that the agency thinks will raise prices, corporate non-compete clauses identified as exploitative, and pharmaceutical middle-men that Khan argues are responsible for raising prices. Over at the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division (where Remer worked), Kanter has similarly sued Google, Apple, TicketMaster, and others, in addition to challenging mergers thought to have negative impacts on consumers in the airline and other industries. Both associated with the \"New Brandeis\" movement that argues consolidated private power is dangerous for society, Khan and Kanter have worked together to change the federal government's merger guidelines and more.\n\nRemer is glad to see this new approach from the Biden administration: \"Under the Bush administration, there was very little or very loose antitrust enforcement. They tried to block a small handful of mergers, but the most prominent one was Oracle PeopleSoft, and they lost that one.\" Remer thinks this created a hesitancy to bring antitrust cases for the rest of Bush's tenure as president. Even in the Obama administration, while \"they became more active and started bringing some more cases, which I think was good, we still didn't see any prominent conduct cases or abusive monopoly power cases,\" he said.\n\nRemer thinks it's possible that this could have been because \"Amazon and Google were growing, but they weren't quite the behemoths that they are today.\" On the Trump administration, Remer said \"I don't know exactly what was going on during the Trump administration, but certainly not strict antitrust enforcement.\"\n\nOn the Biden administration's antitrust enforcement, Remer observes that it's \"probably more active than it was even during the Obama administration, and we're seeing all these big anti-monopolization cases, and that's what I really think is interesting to see.\" He continued, \"I think there's a lot of conduct by these big tech companies, but also in other industries, that is bad for consumers. So, at least from my view, it's nice to see a lot more activity there.\"\n\nEven though some critics of Khan and Kanter question their efficacy because of some losses in high-profile court cases, Remer sees this as misplaced. \"That's kind of what you want,\" he said. \"If you think that there's been under-enforcement of antitrust laws, the only way to find out how much enforcement we should have is by taking risks. For example, the FTC [under Khan] lost its case blocking Microsoft/Activision merger. Well, if that's a case that's sort of on the margin, the only way to sort of push the case law and see how far you can take it is by bringing a case like that to court. If you win 100% of your cases, you're probably not bringing enough of them.\"\n\nRemer thinks the shift in antitrust enforcement from the federal government will be long lasting. \"The antitrust laws, for the most part, have not been changed since the Sherman Act, other than some minor tweaks. So what we now believe about what types of behaviors and what types of mergers are deemed illegal has really evolved through case law just by virtue of bringing more cases. Just by bringing these anti-monopolization cases or abusive monopoly power cases, they're going to have a big, lasting impact. One monumental case can have an effect for decades.\"\n\nAdditionally, Remer sees importance in another area of the federal government's antitrust and consumer protection work: the guidelines they publish for mergers. These guidelines, Remer explained, serve to articulate and tell businesses what the antitrust division and FTC will look for when evaluating mergers or monopolies. \"The previous version of the DOJ's merger guidelines was released in 2010, and before that, it was 1992, so it's pretty infrequently they get updated. And during the Biden administration, one of the top priorities was to update the merger guidelines.\" He continued, \"The new guidelines were released in December 2023 and there's a lot of stuff in there that wasn't really mentioned or had got very little weight in the previous merger guidelines.\" Among these new considerations that Remer discussed were the number of mergers in an industry, whether venture capital was buying up a bunch of smaller companies in the sector, effects of mergers on innovation, and the impacts mergers have on the labor market.\n\n\"So by virtue of just putting out these new guidelines, I think we're going to see a big shift in the types and the number of cases that are brought by the antitrust agencies, and that's definitely going to have a lasting impact.\"\n\nAdditionally, when thinking about which parts of the Biden Antitrust legacy will be most impactful, Remer reflected on the importance of Khan and Kanter starting to challenge vertical mergers rather than just horizontal mergers. Vertical mergers are when companies buy their suppliers, and these used to be widely accepted because of the potential for lowering the final cost to consumers. While he's unsure how the cases have ended up in court, Remer talked about how the Biden Administration has taken a harder stance on vertical mergers after putting more consideration into the effects of mergers on labor markets, among other things.\n\n\"Up until the Biden administration, what was usually analyzed in antitrust cases was the impact on the final consumer price,\" Remer said, and explained how that would allow businesses to cite potential lower markups and lower final prices to justify their mergers. Part of this, he thinks, is because changes in final price is an easier thing to measure, relative to other factors.\n\n\"But the problem is, there's all these other effects of competition. For example, innovation, labor, quality, all that stuff gets ignored when you only focus on final price effect. But what the Biden administration has done is, say 'hey, just because we can't measure this thing precisely doesn't mean there's not going to be harm from a merger or from monopoly conduct, and we're going to find other ways to tell our story of harm here.' And there's been a much more willingness to sort of not go in there with hard numbers.\"\n\nRemer clarified that there's nothing inherently illegal about being a monopoly.\n\n\"Our antitrust laws do not prevent you from becoming a monopolist if you compete on the merits. So that's not why Amazon, Google, Apple, etc, are getting these lawsuits. What is true, though, is that if a company has substantial market power, there's lots of things that now it's not allowed to do that are considered an abuse of monopoly power, and a lot of these things you cannot do have kind of been determined by the case law that's evolved over the past 100 years.\"\n\n\"Once we've proven that they have a lot of market power, [the enforcers] ask, 'are the things that they are doing harmful to the competition and harmful to consumers or competition?'\"\n\nReferencing the DOJ's antitrust case against Google for abusing their market power to crowd out potential search bar competition, Remer said, \"a lot of it revolved around the payments that Google was making to Apple, which resulted in billions of dollars sent to Apple annually in return for making Google the default search browser on the iPhone. And Google argues that they have all this market power because they're better than everyone else, and that's why people like them. But, the simple counterargument to that is, well, 'if that's true, why do you need to pay Apple millions of dollars to be the default search engine?'\"\n\nWhile exploring the example to shed light on how these cases work, Remer discussed how the DOJ called a behavioral economist to testify about the economic advantage of being the default search engine. The DOJ found lots of internal Google documents that showed they knew the economic advantage of being the default search engine. \"So, again, it's not the status itself of being a monopolist that's anti-competitive. But when you combine that market power with actions to stop competition, it's like, well, who has a chance?\"\n\nKhan and Kanter were both appointed by Biden, who will no longer be in office in four months. On the question of antitrust changes of a new administration, Remer said \"What's not going to change is the staff that works there, and they're the ones that make those places run. But what the staff can't do is to make decisions about what cases to bring and not bring -- they can only make recommendations.\"\n\n\"My hope is that the current cases that are already filed will continue to proceed. If they're already in court they'll continue to proceed. What could happen is that the new administration decides to settle the cases out of court. And, I don't think it takes a genius to suspect that Harris's administration would be more in line with Biden's antitrust approach than Trump's would be,\" Remer said.\n\nRemer is continuing to research market power and antitrust. With Swarthmore students as research assistants, Remer is currently working on a paper that goes back to the basics of antitrust philosophy. \"One of the original reasons for antitrust was just having too much political power, and that these companies are just too powerful. And since the 1960s-1970s, this concern was completely lost as a concern of antitrust policy. I'm not entirely sure why, but it's partly that it's hard to measure how powerful a company is.\"\n\n\"Something we're looking at is the public information of how much all these companies lobby. We're collecting data on corporate concentration, so what we're looking at is when we see the amount of concentration, basically the size of these companies, does that impact how much they lobby, which government entities they lobby, and how much the industry itself lobbies.\"\n\nThis work, and an additional paper on airline merger pricing will take up Professor Remer's time for the foreseeable future.",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley: iPhone 16 Lead Times Shorter Than Previous Models, Supply Improves - EconoTimes",
        "body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is seeing shorter lead times for its latest iPhone 16 models compared to its predecessors, according to a report released Tuesday by Morgan Stanley. The note suggests improved supply for the tech giant, though the investment bank remains cautious about predicting the overall sales performance based on current data.\n\nShares of Apple fell nearly 1% in premarket trading on Wednesday following the report.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, the average lead time for the iPhone 16 in the U.S. is 15.2 days, as of September 24 -- 11 days after pre-orders began, as stated also in this article from CNBC. This marks a significant decrease from the 25.7-day lead time for the iPhone 15 at the same point last year and 18 days for the iPhone 14.\n\nShorter Lead Times Also Evident Internationally\n\nThe trend of shorter wait times extends beyond U.S. borders. Internationally, the average lead time for the iPhone 16 stands at 16.3 days, down from 28.5 days for the iPhone 15 during the same timeframe.\n\nWhile Morgan Stanley analysts attribute these shorter lead times to an improved supply chain, they urge caution in interpreting the data. \"While supply is improved, and we hear anecdotes of positive iPhone 16 demand, we still interpret these data points more cautiously,\" the note reads.\n\nNotably, lead times for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models are significantly shorter than in previous cycles. Currently, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a lead time of 25.5 days in the U.S., 18 days less than the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Similarly, the iPhone 16 Pro's lead time has shortened to 18.5 days, down from 21.5 days just last Friday.\n\nCaution Over Predictive Sales Data\n\nDespite the shortened lead times, Morgan Stanley warns that these early metrics lack strong predictive power for the entire sales cycle. The trajectory closely resembles past iPhone cycles, with lead times peaking around seven days after pre-orders began.\n\nAccording to a reliable site, the analysts suggest a greater than 50% chance of potential iPhone production cuts in the coming weeks, a move that could impact Apple's revenue in the December quarter. They anticipate that any production revisions could materialize as early as October, potentially affecting fourth-quarter revenue forecasts.",

The visual clarity and smooth animations make it an engaging game on smartphones. European and American roulette variants are available, with mobile games often offering customizable settings for bet limits.\n\nLive Baccarat brings the casino floor to your screen, offering real-time gameplay with a live dealer (usually streamed in HD). It's one of the best games to experience on mobile due to its interactive nature, and it runs smoothly on most mobile and tablet devices. The high-quality graphics and live chat make it feel like a real casino experience, or at least as close as you're going to get behind a screen!\n\nDuelz Casino offers a 100% match bonus up to $100 for new mobile players, along with 10 free spins. This bonus is ideal for those who love mobile slots, as Duelz boasts over 1,000 slot games.

This is an exclusive offer for those who download and use the bet365 mobile app. It's perfect for mobile sports betting fans as well as casino players, providing extra funds to explore the site's live betting and sports markets.\n\nHot Streak Slots gives new players a 100% match bonus up to $100, plus 10 free spins. Mobile players will love this bonus, especially those into progressive jackpot slots. With over 1,500 mobile-optimized games and fast transactions, this bonus adds value and excitement for slot lovers on the go.\n\nPlayGrand Casino rewards its VIP players with exclusive bonuses, including cashback and higher match deposit offers. As part of their multi-level VIP program, mobile players can unlock free spins, no-deposit bonuses, and even personal account managers. This is a great perk for frequent mobile users looking for ongoing rewards.\n\nEnsure your device is protected by enabling security features like biometric authentication (fingerprint or face recognition) and setting a strong password. Keep your operating system and apps updated to avoid vulnerabilities. Using mobile-specific security software can also prevent malware from compromising your personal data while playing at mobile casinos.\n\nAlways play at mobile casinos that are licensed by reputable authorities like the Malta Gaming Authority or the UK Gambling Commission. These casinos follow strict security protocols and are regularly audited, ensuring a safe gambling environment. Check for SSL encryption on the casino's mobile site to protect your data during transactions.\n\nOpt for secure and reputable payment methods like Interac, PayPal, or credit cards for mobile deposits and withdrawals. These services offer additional security features, such as encryption and fraud protection. Avoid using public Wi-Fi when making transactions to prevent unauthorized access to your sensitive financial information.\n\nWhere available, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your casino account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone) when logging in or making transactions. It significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your account.\n\nMost mobile casinos offer tools to set deposit, wagering, and time limits. Use these features to maintain control over your gambling habits and prevent overspending. Regularly check your gaming history to monitor your activity and stay aware of your spending. If necessary, consider taking breaks or using self-exclusion options.\n\nInterac is a popular payment method for Canadian players, offering fast and secure transactions directly from your bank account. It's easy to use on mobile devices, with low to no fees for deposits and withdrawals. Most casinos process Interac transactions instantly, though withdrawals may take 1-2 business days. The downside is that not all mobile casinos accept Interac for withdrawals.\n\nVisa and Mastercard are widely accepted at mobile casinos and offer secure, instant deposits. These credit and debit cards are convenient for players who prefer a familiar method. However, withdrawals can take 2-5 business days to process, and some casinos may charge fees for using cards, especially for withdrawals.\n\nPayPal is known for its security and ease of use, making it a great option for mobile players. Transactions are typically instant, with no fees for deposits or withdrawals. PayPal also offers buyer protection, adding an extra layer of security. The downside is that PayPal is not accepted at all Canadian mobile casinos.\n\nMuchBetter is a mobile-specific e-wallet that offers fast deposits and withdrawals with minimal fees. Its app is designed for mobile users, making it a seamless choice for casino payments. Transactions are processed instantly, and the app provides high-level security with device pairing and fingerprint login. The main drawback is that it's still gaining popularity, so not all casinos support it.\n\nSkrill is a popular e-wallet for Canadian players, known for fast transactions and mobile-friendly features. Deposits are usually instant, and withdrawals take around 24 hours, making it a speedy option for mobile users. However, Skrill may charge fees for certain transactions, and some mobile casinos exclude Skrill deposits from bonus eligibility.\n\nWhen reviewing and rating mobile casinos, I consider several key factors that ensure a smooth, secure, and enjoyable experience. From design and device compatibility to game variety and payment options, each aspect plays a crucial role in delivering the best mobile casino experience. Here's a breakdown of the criteria I use:\n\nA great mobile casino should have a clean, responsive design that works smoothly across different devices, whether iOS or Android. The interface must be easy to navigate with clear menus and quick access to games and features. I check for loading times and how well the platform adapts to various screen sizes for an optimal user experience as well.\n\nSecurity is a top priority, so I look for casinos with SSL encryption which protects user data and transactions. Casinos should be licensed by reputable authorities like the Malta Gaming Authority or UK Gambling Commission. Additional safety features such as two-factor authentication (2FA) and responsible gambling tools are also important when assessing mobile security.\n\nI assess whether the mobile casino offers a diverse selection of games, including slots, table games, and live dealer options. The availability of mobile-specific promotions, such as welcome bonuses or free spins, is also key. A wide variety of games from top providers, paired with generous promotions, ensures a richer gaming experience.\n\nReliable and secure payment methods are essential for mobile casinos. I look for a range of banking options, including Interac, PayPal, and credit cards, along with e-wallets like Skrill or MuchBetter. Fast deposit and withdrawal times, low fees, and mobile-optimized payment gateways are crucial to enhancing convenience for players, so I make sure that the operators I suggest have those in abundance as well.\n\nI evaluate whether the casino offers a dedicated mobile app or if the site functions seamlessly in a mobile browser. A well-designed app improves the gaming experience with one-tap access, better performance, and exclusive app-only features. If an app is not available, I ensure the mobile browser version still delivers high-quality gameplay.\n\nDuelz, Mr Vegas, and bet365 are among the best mobile casinos in Canada. These casinos stand out for their mobile usability, game variety, and excellent security. Each offers a smooth mobile experience, whether through a dedicated app or an optimized mobile site, ensuring players can enjoy top-quality games and promotions on the go, so I 100% recommend them!\n\nYes, mobile casinos are legal in Canada, but they must be licensed. Most mobile casinos that accept Canadian players are licensed by reputable authorities such as the Malta Gaming Authority or UK Gambling Commission. As long as the casino is licensed, it's safe and legal to play from your mobile device in Canada.\n\nbet365, Casumo, and Duelz offer some of the best mobile casino apps. These apps provide fast navigation, exclusive bonuses, and access to hundreds of games. They're designed for both iOS and Android, offering high security, smooth performance, and features like live betting and live dealer games.\n\nYes, you can win real money on casino apps. Mobile casino apps allow players to wager real money on a variety of games such as slots, poker, blackjack, and live dealer games. Once you win, you can withdraw your earnings through secure payment methods like Interac or PayPal.\n\nNo, but most games are available on mobile. Many online casinos optimize their most popular slots, table games, and live dealer games for mobile play. However, some older or niche games may only be available on desktop. Mobile game libraries usually include hundreds of titles.\n\nYes, many mobile casinos offer free demo versions of games. Players can try out slots and table games in demo mode without wagering real money. This is a great way to practice or explore new games before making a deposit. However, live dealer games are usually not available for free play, so bear that in mind.\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the casino offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 19+.

        "body": "Amazon Great Indian Festival 2024: The iPhone 13 can be acquired for around ₹40,000 by combining offers, but is it?\n\nAmazon Great Indian Festival Sale 2024 is now live, featuring one of the most sought-after deals: the iPhone 13 for around ₹40,000. However, as of today, September 26, this offer is available exclusively for Amazon Prime members. If you're interested in purchasing the device at this price, you'll need to subscribe to Amazon Prime or use a friend's account. It's worth noting that the listed price isn't exactly under ₹40,000, as Amazon raised the price shortly after the sale began. However, there are a few offers available that can help reduce the cost. Read on for the details.\n\nAlso Read: iPhone 16 least popular since iPhone 12, new survey reflects on minimal updates\n\nCurrently, the iPhone 13 is priced at ₹41,999 on Amazon India, which is still less than its typical selling price of around ₹50,000. To get closer to the ₹40,000 mark, you can use an SBI credit or debit card to lower the price to ₹40,749. Additionally, if you exchange a phone, the price drops even further. If you have an Amazon ICICI Pay credit card, you can receive a cashback of ₹2,100, bringing the effective price down to ₹39,899. However, the ICICI cashback isn't instant; it will be credited in your Amazon Pay account at the end of the card billing cycle.\n\nAlso Read: iOS 18 release brings this useful Truecaller feature for iPhone users- Details\n\nWe wouldn't recommend you to buy the iPhone 13 if you're looking for a fast 120Hz display or the best stills camera available. While the iPhone 13 is a solid phone, it's now a few years old with outdated internals and a camera that falls short of 2024 standards. It does offer good video capabilities with Cinematic Mode, but for the same price, you could find better Android options like the Samsung Galaxy S23 on Flipkart or the OnePlus 12R on Amazon. That said, the iPhone 13 could be a suitable choice for someone who simply needs a reliable phone for basic tasks. As an Apple product, it will continue to receive updates for the foreseeable future, and it's equipped with a powerful A15 chipset, which remains sufficient for most tasks. If you're seeking to join the Apple ecosystem, the iPhone 13 could serve as an affordable gateway.",

        "title": "Why Does My iPhone Keep Asking Me to Check In With My Ex?",
        "body": "An iPhone feature has some users baffled as they are asked to share their location with work acquaintances, dead relatives and people on other continents.\n\nSimon was waiting for a ride home one evening when he received a strange notification on his iPhone. It appeared with the iMessage logo, almost like a text message, but it was a suggestion from Siri, Apple's virtual assistant. \"Start a Check In with Daniel,\" the phone prompted him. \"Let them know when you arrive at your destination.\"\n\nSimon, who works in artificial intelligence at a company in British Columbia and asked to be identified only by his first name because he was commenting on the work of another tech company, was amused by the notification and took a screenshot. Daniel was his old roommate who lived nearly 5,000 miles away, on a completely different continent: Why on earth would his phone think he'd want to check in with him?\n\n\"I found it funny,\" Simon said in a phone interview. \"He is in my Favorites on my phone, so I'm guessing that's how Apple does these recommendations. But it still just doesn't make any sense, because I also have his address saved in my contacts, so my phone should know that we live on different continents.\"\n\nOther iPhone users have not been so amused by the Siri feature, which was released with iOS 17 last year. Since then, the internet has been inundated with posts from users wondering why their phones want them to check in with seemingly random contacts.\n\nMany have taken to Reddit, describing the prompts as distressing or surprising, with some saying the messages had caused tension in their relationships over what felt like an attempt to control their movements. One user was asked to Check In with an ex they were no longer in touch with and others were asked to send them to managers, casual acquaintances, old enemies and, on at least one occasion, a deceased mother.\n\nLeo Margul, a 37-year-old writer living in Los Angeles, said that on two occasions he was leaving concerts when Siri prompted him to start a Check In with his mother, who lives across the country in Boston. When he posted the screenshot to Reddit, other users chimed in to say that they had received similar notifications, but that their parents had passed away.",

        "body": "The iPhone 16 Pro Max price has been continuously updated. As the Apple iPhone 16 series is officially on sale, many people consider the iPhone as a \"speculative product\" or a \"technology toy.\" We will closely follow the market conditions starting from the launch of the iPhone 16 series, so that everyone can ⁢update the ⁤recycling price of ⁢the iPhone 16⁣ series at any time.\n\nEvery year, many fruit farmers are concerned about ⁢the speculative price of the new iPhone. This year,⁢ although many people are not optimistic about the speculative price, the morning of September 20 saw a better-than-expected outcome. Around 10am, most of the Zenda stores have⁣ opened, and the speculative recycling iPhone⁤ 16 Pro Max generally has a water level of 1,000 or 2,000 yuan.\n\n(Updated to 1:00 noon on September 26) Many goods from Suzhou have arrived in Hong Kong today,⁣ and the price ⁢of 512 Dasha and other styles has dropped immediately, with the ⁢water level only about 300 yuan. However, there is ⁣still a good water level at ⁤256 Dasha, and the water level ⁣in the black and white machine is even higher. Among them, the price of 1TB in black and white is as high as 1,400 yuan, ⁢which is unexpected.\n\nThe best ⁤price is still the gold iPhone 16 Pro Max 256GB, which is still around $2300 - $2500 per water level. However, we know from ⁤past ⁤experience that the demand for 1TB is always low. If many people order and receive goods late, the water level will ⁣drop, which is a high risk.",

The visual clarity and smooth animations make it an engaging game on smartphones. European and American roulette variants are available, with mobile games often offering customizable settings for bet limits.\n\nLive Baccarat brings the casino floor to your screen, offering real-time gameplay with a live dealer (usually streamed in HD). It's one of the best games to experience on mobile due to its interactive nature, and it runs smoothly on most mobile and tablet devices. The high-quality graphics and live chat make it feel like a real casino experience, or at least as close as you're going to get behind a screen!\n\nDuelz Casino offers a 100% match bonus up to $100 for new mobile players, along with 10 free spins.

This is an exclusive offer for those who download and use the bet365 mobile app. It's perfect for mobile sports betting fans as well as casino players, providing extra funds to explore the site's live betting and sports markets.\n\nHot Streak Slots gives new players a 100% match bonus up to $100, plus 10 free spins.

As part of their multi-level VIP program, mobile players can unlock free spins, no-deposit bonuses, and even personal account managers. This is a great perk for frequent mobile users looking for ongoing rewards.\n\nEnsure your device is protected by enabling security features like biometric authentication (fingerprint or face recognition) and setting a strong password. Keep your operating system and apps updated to avoid vulnerabilities. Using mobile-specific security software can also prevent malware from compromising your personal data while playing at mobile casinos.\n\nAlways play at mobile casinos that are licensed by reputable authorities like the Malta Gaming Authority or the UK Gambling Commission. These casinos follow strict security protocols and are regularly audited, ensuring a safe gambling environment. Check for SSL encryption on the casino's mobile site to protect your data during transactions.\n\nOpt for secure and reputable payment methods like Interac, PayPal, or credit cards for mobile deposits and withdrawals. These services offer additional security features, such as encryption and fraud protection. Avoid using public Wi-Fi when making transactions to prevent unauthorized access to your sensitive financial information.\n\nWhere available, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your casino account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone) when logging in or making transactions. It significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your account.\n\nMost mobile casinos offer tools to set deposit, wagering, and time limits. Use these features to maintain control over your gambling habits and prevent overspending. Regularly check your gaming history to monitor your activity and stay aware of your spending. If necessary, consider taking breaks or using self-exclusion options.\n\nInterac is a popular payment method for Canadian players, offering fast and secure transactions directly from your bank account. It's easy to use on mobile devices, with low to no fees for deposits and withdrawals. Most casinos process Interac transactions instantly, though withdrawals may take 1-2 business days. The downside is that not all mobile casinos accept Interac for withdrawals.\n\nVisa and Mastercard are widely accepted at mobile casinos and offer secure, instant deposits. These credit and debit cards are convenient for players who prefer a familiar method. However, withdrawals can take 2-5 business days to process, and some casinos may charge fees for using cards, especially for withdrawals.\n\nPayPal is known for its security and ease of use, making it a great option for mobile players. Transactions are typically instant, with no fees for deposits or withdrawals. PayPal also offers buyer protection, adding an extra layer of security. The downside is that PayPal is not accepted at all Canadian mobile casinos.\n\nMuchBetter is a mobile-specific e-wallet that offers fast deposits and withdrawals with minimal fees. Its app is designed for mobile users, making it a seamless choice for casino payments. Transactions are processed instantly, and the app provides high-level security with device pairing and fingerprint login. The main drawback is that it's still gaining popularity, so not all casinos support it.\n\nSkrill is a popular e-wallet for Canadian players, known for fast transactions and mobile-friendly features. Deposits are usually instant, and withdrawals take around 24 hours, making it a speedy option for mobile users. However, Skrill may charge fees for certain transactions, and some mobile casinos exclude Skrill deposits from bonus eligibility.\n\nWhen reviewing and rating mobile casinos, I consider several key factors that ensure a smooth, secure, and enjoyable experience. From design and device compatibility to game variety and payment options, each aspect plays a crucial role in delivering the best mobile casino experience. Here's a breakdown of the criteria I use:\n\nA great mobile casino should have a clean, responsive design that works smoothly across different devices, whether iOS or Android. The interface must be easy to navigate with clear menus and quick access to games and features. I check for loading times and how well the platform adapts to various screen sizes for an optimal user experience as well.\n\nSecurity is a top priority, so I look for casinos with SSL encryption which protects user data and transactions. Casinos should be licensed by reputable authorities like the Malta Gaming Authority or UK Gambling Commission. Additional safety features such as two-factor authentication (2FA) and responsible gambling tools are also important when assessing mobile security.\n\nI assess whether the mobile casino offers a diverse selection of games, including slots, table games, and live dealer options. The availability of mobile-specific promotions, such as welcome bonuses or free spins, is also key. A wide variety of games from top providers, paired with generous promotions, ensures a richer gaming experience.\n\nReliable and secure payment methods are essential for mobile casinos. I look for a range of banking options, including Interac, PayPal, and credit cards, along with e-wallets like Skrill or MuchBetter. Fast deposit and withdrawal times, low fees, and mobile-optimized payment gateways are crucial to enhancing convenience for players, so I make sure that the operators I suggest have those in abundance as well.\n\nI evaluate whether the casino offers a dedicated mobile app or if the site functions seamlessly in a mobile browser. A well-designed app improves the gaming experience with one-tap access, better performance, and exclusive app-only features. If an app is not available, I ensure the mobile browser version still delivers high-quality gameplay.\n\nDuelz, Mr Vegas, and bet365 are among the best mobile casinos in Canada. These casinos stand out for their mobile usability, game variety, and excellent security. Each offers a smooth mobile experience, whether through a dedicated app or an optimized mobile site, ensuring players can enjoy top-quality games and promotions on the go, so I 100% recommend them!\n\nYes, mobile casinos are legal in Canada, but they must be licensed. Most mobile casinos that accept Canadian players are licensed by reputable authorities such as the Malta Gaming Authority or UK Gambling Commission. As long as the casino is licensed, it's safe and legal to play from your mobile device in Canada.\n\nbet365, Casumo, and Duelz offer some of the best mobile casino apps. These apps provide fast navigation, exclusive bonuses, and access to hundreds of games. They're designed for both iOS and Android, offering high security, smooth performance, and features like live betting and live dealer games.\n\nYes, you can win real money on casino apps. Mobile casino apps allow players to wager real money on a variety of games such as slots, poker, blackjack, and live dealer games. Once you win, you can withdraw your earnings through secure payment methods like Interac or PayPal.\n\nNo, but most games are available on mobile. Many online casinos optimize their most popular slots, table games, and live dealer games for mobile play. However, some older or niche games may only be available on desktop. Mobile game libraries usually include hundreds of titles.\n\nYes, many mobile casinos offer free demo versions of games. Players can try out slots and table games in demo mode without wagering real money. This is a great way to practice or explore new games before making a deposit. However, live dealer games are usually not available for free play, so bear that in mind.\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the casino offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 19+.

        "title": "Meta takes some big AI swings at Meta Connect 2024",
        "body": "Also: Everything announced at Meta Connect 2024: $299 Quest 3S, Orion AR glasses, and more\n\nIn this article, though, we'll dig into several powerful and impressive announcements related to the company's AI efforts.\n\nZuckerberg announced the availability of Llama 3.2, which adds multimodal capabilities. In particular, the model can understand images.\n\nHe compared Meta's Llama 3.2 large language models with other LLMs, saying Meta \"Differentiates itself in this category by offering not only state of the art models, but unlimited access to those models for free, and integrated easily into our different products and apps.\"\n\nAlso: Meta inches toward open-source AI\n\nMeta AI is Meta's AI assistant, now based on Llama 3.2. Zuckerberg stated Meta is on track to be the most used AI assistant globally, having almost 500 million monthly active users.\n\nTo demonstrate the model's understanding of images, Zuckerberg opened an image on a mobile device using the company's image-edit capability. Meta AI was able to change the image, modifying a shirt to tie-dye or adding a helmet, all in response to simple text prompts.\n\nMeta's AI assistant is now able to hold voice conversations with you from within Meta's apps. I've been using a similar feature in ChatGPT and found it useful when two or more people need to hear the answer to a question.\n\nZuckerberg claims that AI voice interaction will be bigger than text chatbots, and I agree -- with one caveat. Getting to the voice interaction has to be easy. For example, to ask Alexa a question, you simply speak into the room. But to ask ChatGPT a question on the iPhone, you have to unlock the phone, go into the ChatGPT app, and then enable the feature.\n\nAlso: AI voice generators: What they can do and how they work\n\nUntil Meta has devices that just naturally listen for speech, I fear even the most capable voice assistants will be constrained by inconvenience.\n\nYou can also give your AI assistant a celebrity voice. Choose from John Cena, Judi Dench, Kristen Bell, Keegan-Michael Key, and Awkwafina. Natural voice conversation will be available in Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger Facebook and is rolling out today.\n\nNext up are some features Meta has added to its AI Studio chatbot creation tool. AI Studio lets you create a character (either an AI based on your interests or an AI that \"is an extension of you\"). Essentially, you can create a chatbot that mirrors your conversational style.\n\nBut now Meta is diving into the realm of uncanny valley deepfakes.\n\nAI Studio, until this announcement, contained a text-based interface. But Meta is releasing a version that is \"more natural, embodied, interactive.\" And when it comes to \"embodied\", they're not kidding around.\n\nIn the demo, Zuckerberg interacted with a chatbot modeled on creator Don Allen Stevenson III. This interaction appeared to be a \"live\" video of Stevenson, full and completely tracking head motion and lip animations. Basically, he could ask Robot Don a question and it looked like the real guy was answering.\n\nAlso: How Apple, Google, and Microsoft can save us from AI deepfakes\n\nPowerful, freaky, and unnerving. Plus, the potential for creating malicious chatbots using other folks' faces seems a distinct possibility.\n\nMeta seems to have artificial lip-synch and facial movements tied down. They've reached a point where they can make a real person's face move and speak generated words.\n\nMeta has extended this capability to translation. They now offer automatic video dubbing on Reels, in English and Spanish. That feature means you can record a Reel in Spanish, and the social will play it back in English -- and it will look like you're speaking English. Or you can record in English and it will play back in Spanish, as if you're speaking in Spanish.\n\nIn the above example, creator Ivan Acuña spoke in Spanish, but the dub came back in English. As with the previous example, the video was nearly perfect and it looked like Acuña had been recorded speaking English originally.\n\nZuckerberg came back for another dip into the Llama 3.2 model. He said the multimodal nature of the model has increased the parameter count considerably.\n\nAnother interesting part of the announcement was the much smaller 1B and 3B models optimized to work on-device. This effort will allow developers to create more secure and specialized models for custom apps, that live right in the app.\n\nAlso: I've tested dozens of AI chatbots since ChatGPT's stunning debut. Here's my top pick\n\nBoth of these models are open source, and Zuckerberg was touting the idea that Llama is becoming \"the Linux of the AI industry\".\n\nFinally, a bunch more AI features were announced for Meta's AI glasses. We have another article that goes into those features in detail.",

        "title": "Flipkart Big Billion Days sale now live: iPhone 15 Pro gets huge discount",
        "body": "Flipkart Big Billion Days Sale is now live and the platform kept its promise of offering huge discounts on iPhones. While the iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhone 15 Plus are selling at a lower price, Flipkart is giving the best deal on the iPhone 15 Pro. It was announced in India at Rs 1,34,999 and is now on sale for less than Rs 1 lakh. Here are the details.\n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro is listed with a price tag of Rs 99,999 at Flipkart's Big Billion Days sale. This price is for the 128GB storage model. As mentioned above, the iPhone 15 Pro was announced in India at Rs 1,34,999. So, Flipkart is giving a discount of Rs 35,000 without any conditions, making it the best iPhone deal of 2024.\n\nIn addition to this, there is also Rs 5,000 discount offer on HDFC bank cards, which will effectively reduce the price to Rs 94,999. It is important to note that once this Flipkart Diwali sale ends, the iPhone 15 Pro will again be sold for more than Rs 1 lakh. Speaking of which, it is currently unknown when this iPhone 15 deal will expire. If we take a look at the track record of Flipkart, the e-commerce giant has offered good discount deals for a limited time period. So, there are chances that the company could decide to take down the iPhone 15 Pro offer.\n\nUsers can always consider claiming the exchange offers to get even more discount. People who are opting for exchange offers are advised to check exchange deals on Cashify as well. It is always better to check deals across different platforms to get the best deal.\n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro has a light, durable titanium chassis with a brushed effect to reduce fingerprint smudges. The device's edges are smoother and more rounded where the metal meets the glass. You will also see a USB-C port at the bottom.\n\nApple has given the 6.1-inch screen on the regular Pro version. It features a Super Retina XDR display with support for 120Hz ProMotion technology. It supports the always-on display feature and is even eligible for Apple Intelligence. People can download the latest iOS 18 software as well.\n\nIt is driven by the A17 Pro chip, a powerhouse that Apple claims delivers unmatched performance in the smartphone realm, potentially rivalling even high-end PCs. With a revamped GPU at its core, you can get a solid gaming experience on the iPhone 15 Pro. The latest iPhone 15 Pro smartphone comes in attractive colours, including Black titanium, white titanium, blue titanium, and natural titanium.\n\nApple claims the camera system on the iPhone 15 Pro models is \"the equivalent of seven camera lenses in your pocket.\" The iPhone 15 Pro model features a 48-megapixel camera for better low-light and lens flare-free photos. Users can switch between focal lengths (24mm, 28mm, 35mm) and achieve 3x optical zoom. It supports 4K60 ProRes video recording and direct external drive connectivity via the USB-C port. In short, the iPhone 15 Pro is currently one of the best phones in the market.",

        "title": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
        "body": "Warren Buffett's investing career has inspired countless investors to follow his strategy. There's no better way to start imitating the Oracle of Omaha than to follow his stock selections at Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nBerkshire owns dozens of privately owned businesses, but Buffett looks at buying stocks the same way as buying the whole business. Here are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio to hold for a lifetime.\n\nDespite weak consumer spending trends this year, the beverage industry has remained resilient. Coca-Cola posted a 15% year-over-year increase in adjusted revenue in Q2, driven by balanced increases in pricing and concentrate sales.\n\nThe company has a powerful brand that gives the business a durable competitive advantage. Coca-Cola has valuable relationships with retail partners due to the brand's ability to drive sales. For example, the company recently launched a lighter and more affordable bottle in India that has extended shelf life, which is helping reach more customers and reduce costs.\n\nCoke is also leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to adjust pricing, which is driving revenue growth but also will lead to more efficient operations over time. The company's margins were up last quarter and that's a good sign of what's to come in a stronger demand environment.\n\nThe carbonated soft drink industry continues to show long-term growth potential. Statista estimates the revenue in the at-home market will grow 5% annually through 2028. Coca-Cola stock should grow in value over the long term, and investors also get the benefit of a forward dividend yield of 2.70% to pad returns.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has soared to new highs following the announcement of Apple Intelligence in June. Investors see a strong upgrade cycle coming for the iPhone, which generates most of Apple's $385 billion in annual sales.\n\nWhile Berkshire reduced its massive stake in Q2, Buffett isn't selling out of Apple. He previously called Apple a superior business to any Berkshire owns, and he mentioned at this year's shareholders' meeting that the stock will likely remain Berkshire's largest investment by the end of the year.\n\nWith an installed base of more than 2.2 billion active devices, Apple Intelligence is a free update coming to Apple's software but is expected to drive a major upgrade cycle for Apple over the next few years, since it will require devices with more recent processors. The AI features will undoubtedly reshape how millions of customers interact with their devices, and that could lead to another stretch of strong growth.\n\nUltimately, the most attractive opportunity for Apple is the impact a growing installed base of devices will do for its lucrative services business. Revenue from services is already hitting new records heading into the launch of Apple Intelligence next month, up 14% year-over-year last quarter. Apple has made investments to expand the content offering across Apple TV+ and other services, which has driven paid subscriptions to surpass 1 billion.\n\nApple stock is trading at a higher price-to-earnings ratio than when Buffett first bought shares in 2016, but investors should expect the stock to follow the growth in Apple's earnings. It's one of the most valuable brands in the world that should grow more valuable in the AI era.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $740,704!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than quadrupled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nJohn Ballard has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple and Berkshire Hathaway.
